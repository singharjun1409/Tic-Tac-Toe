# Tic-Tac-Toe

This Python program implements a simple command-line version of Tic Tac Toe for two players. The game board is represented using a list, and players take turns choosing positions marked by numbers 1 through 9. The program checks for valid moves, alternates between players using "X" and "O", and evaluates the board after each turn to determine if there's a winner or a draw. It also includes functions to display the board, check win conditions, and reset the game for replay. The code demonstrates fundamental concepts like loops, conditionals, and functions in Python.
